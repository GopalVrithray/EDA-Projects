## Introduction

Understanding the factors that influence student performance is crucial for educators and policymakers. This project explores various attributes related to student.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Demographics:** Age, gender, etc.
- **Socio-economic Status:** Parental education, free/reduced lunch, etc.
- **Academic Records:** Test scores, grades, etc.
- **Attendance and Behavior:** Attendance records, disciplinary actions, etc.
